Port 0 is also the multiplexed low-order address and data bus during access to external program and data memory. In this application, it uses strong internal pull-up when emitting 1s. \n Port 1 is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pull-ups. Port 1 pins that have 1s written to them are pulled high by the internal pull-ups and can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port 1 pins that are externally pulled low will source current because of the internal pull-ups. \n Port 2: Port 2 is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pull-ups. Port 2 pins that have 1s written to them are pulled high by the internal pull-ups and can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port 2 pins that are externally pulled low will source current because of the internal pull-ups. Port 2 emits the high-order address byte during fetches from external program memory and during accesses to external data memory that use 16-bit addresses (MOVX @DPTR).In this application, it uses strong internal pull-ups emitting 1s. During accesses to external data memory that use 8-bit addresses (MOVX @Ri), port 2 emits the contents of the P2 SFR.";
